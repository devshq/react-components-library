# react-components-library

## Installation

- Clone this repository, then run `npm i`

## Summary

The goal of this library is to provide a starting point for creating a React component library with following capabilities:

- Develop
- Build
- Publish
- Document
- Test
- Lint

## Start

`npm start`

## Build

`npm run build`

## Publish

`npm publish`

## Create New Component (with SASS, stories, and spec)

`npm run create-component -- name=fooBar`

> Optionally, you can pass isEmpty=true and dir=yourDirName

## TODO

- CSS / SASS Modules? To prevent using same class in different places. For example if we use ".button" for both buttons.
- Hide or fix Jest css import warning
